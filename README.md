```# Acebook by Team Tank Engine
## What is it?

A rails application that attempts to duplicate the functionality of a popular social networking site.

## How Does it Work?

Using the navigation bar at the top of the website, you can make an account, log in, write posts, add comments and 'like' things. Possibly more. Who knows.

### Online
Heroku deployment pending- watch this space!

### Locally
- Clone this repository
- Navigate to the newly cloned directory via your command line
- ```rails db:create```
- ```rails db:migrate```
- ```rails server```
- Visit localhost:[whichever port you racked up to- 3000 by default]
- Make an account, write posts and leave intellectually stimulating comments!

## Our Approach

We used the first day of the week to research and understand Rails as no one in the group was familiar with it. After a lot of reading up and mobbing, we divided up features into Trello board tickets and approached each one in pairs.

## Known Issues/TODOs

- Likes are a bit glitchy!
